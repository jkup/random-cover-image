Random Cover Image
==================

Add a fullscreen, random, royalty free cover image to your website.

This library scrapes [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/) for a random image from their homepage and inserts it into the DOM. For best results, combine it with the SUITCSS classes that you can find in examples/style.css.

## Example

## Install
This library requires the ability to do cross-domain AJAX. I've included a copy of James Paldolsey's cross-domain-ajax library but you can use anything you want.

Just include that little bit of JavaScript in a document.ready and then put something like this in your markup:

    <div class="CoverImage FlexEmbed FlexEmbed--3by1"></div>

## Support
